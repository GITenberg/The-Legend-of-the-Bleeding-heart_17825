<h1><i>The Legend of the
Bleeding-heart</i></h1>


<p>In days of old, when all
things in the Wood had
speech, there lived within its
depths a lone Flax-spinner.
She was a bent old creature,
and ill to look upon, but all
the tongues of all the forest
leaves were ever kept a-wagging
with the story of her<!-- Page 2 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
kindly deeds. And even to
this day they sometimes
whisper low among themselves
(because they fain
would hold in mind so
sweet a tale) the story of
her kindness to the little
orphan, Olga.</p>

<p>'Twas no slight task the
old Flax-spinner took upon
herself, the day she brought
the helpless child to share
the shelter of her thatch.<!-- Page 3 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
The Oak outside her door
held up his arms in solemn
protest.</p>

<p>"Thou dost but waste
thyself," he said. "Thy
benefits will be forgot, thy
labours unrequited. For
Youth is ever but another
title for Ingratitude."</p>

<p>"Nay, friend," the old
Flax-spinner said. "My little
Olga will not be ungrateful
and forgetful."<!-- Page 4 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>All hedged about with
loving care, the orphan grew
to gracious maidenhood, and
felt no lack of father,
mother, brother or sister.
In every way the old Flax-spinner
took their places.
But many were the sacrifices
that she made to keep
her fed and warmly clad,
and every time she went
without herself that Olga
might receive a greater<!-- Page 5 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
share, Wiseacre Oak looked
down and frowned and
shook his head.</p>

<p>Then would the old dame
hasten to her inner room,
and there she pricked herself
with her spindle, until a
great red drop of her heart's
blood fell into her trembling
hand. With witchery of
words she blew upon it,
and rolled it in her palm,
and muttering, turned and<!-- Page 6 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
turned and turned it. And
as the spell was laid upon it,
it shrivelled into a tiny
round ball like a seed, and
she strung it on a thread
where were many others like
it, saying, "By this she will
remember. She will not be
ungrateful and forgetful."</p>

<p>So years went by, and
Olga grew in goodness and
in beauty, and helped the
old Flax-spinner in her tasks<!-- Page 7 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
as blithely and as willingly
as if she were indeed her
daughter. Every morning
she brought water from the
spring, gathered the wild
fruits of the woods, and
spread the linen on the
grass to bleach. At such
times would the bent old
foster-mother hold herself
erect, and call up to the
Oak, "Dost see? Thou'rt
wrong! Youth is <i>not</i> an<!-- Page 8 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>other
title for Ingratitude."</p>

<p>"Thou hast not lived as
long as I," would be the
only answer.</p>

<p>One day as Olga was
wandering by the spring,
searching for watercresses,
the young Prince of the
castle rode by on his prancing
charger. A snow-white
plume waved in his hat, and
a shining silver bugle hung<!-- Page 9 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
from his shoulder, for he
had been following the
chase.</p>

<p>He was thirsty and tired,
and asked for a drink, but
there was no cup with
which to dip the water
from the spring. But Olga
caught the drops as they
bubbled out from the spring,
holding them in the hollow
of her beautiful white hands,
and reaching up to where<!-- Page 10 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
he sat, offered him the
sparkling water. So gracefully
was it done, that the
Prince was charmed by her
modest manner as well as
her lovely face, and baring
his head when he had
slaked his thirst, he touched
the white hands with his
lips.</p>

<p>Before he rode away he
asked her name and where
she lived. The next day a<!-- Page 11 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
courier in scarlet and gold
stopped at the door of the
cottage and invited Olga to
the castle. Princesses and
royal ladies from all over
the realm were to be entertained
there, seven days and
seven nights. Every night
a grand ball was to be
given, and Olga was summoned
to each of the balls.
It was because of her pleasing
manner and her great<!-- Page 12 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
beauty that she had been
bidden.</p>

<p>The old Flax-spinner
courtesied low to the courier
and promised that Olga
should be at the castle
without fail.</p>

<p>"But, good dame," cried
Olga, when the courier had
gone, "prithee tell me why
thou didst make such a
promise, knowing full well
this gown of tow is all I<!-- Page 13 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
own. Wouldst have me
stand before the Prince in
beggar's garb? Better to
bide at home for aye than
be put to shame before such
guests."</p>

<p>"Have done, my child!"
the old dame said. "Thou
shalt wear a court robe of
the finest. Years have I
toiled to have it ready, but
that is naught. I loved
thee as my own."<!-- Page 14 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>Then once more the old
Flax-spinner went into her
inner room, and pricked herself
with her spindle till
another great red drop of
her heart's blood fell into
her trembling hand. With
witchery of words she blew
upon it, and rolled it in her
palm, and muttering, turned
and turned and turned it.
And as the spell was laid
upon it, it shrivelled into a<!-- Page 15 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
tiny round ball like a seed,
and she strung it on to a
thread, where were many
others like it. Seventy
times seven was the number
of beads on this strange
rosary.</p>

<p>When the night of the
first ball rolled around, Olga
combed her long golden hair
and twined it with a wreath
of snowy water-lilies, and
then she stood before the<!-- Page 16 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
old dame in her dress of
tow. To her wonderment
and grief she saw there was
no silken robe in waiting,
only a string of beads to clasp
around her white throat.
Each bead in the necklace
was like a little shrivelled
seed, and Olga's eyes filled
with tears of disappointment.</p>

<p>"Obey me and all will be
well," said the old woman.<!-- Page 17 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>"When thou reachest the
castle gate clasp one bead in
thy fingers and say:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'For love's sweet sake, in my hour of need,<br />
Blossom and deck me, little seed.'</p></div>

<p>Straightway right royally
shalt thou be clad. But remember
carefully the charm.
Only to the magic words,
'For love's sweet sake' will
the necklace give up its
treasures. If thou shouldst<!-- Page 18 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
forget, then thou must be
doomed always to wear thy
gown of tow."</p>

<p>So Olga sped on her
moon-lighted way through
the forest until she came to
the castle gate. There she
paused, and grasping a bead
of the strange necklace between
her fingers, repeated
the old dame's charm:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"For love's sweet sake, in my hour of need,<br />
Blossom and deck me, little seed."</p></div><p><!-- Page 19 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>Immediately the bead
burst with a little puff as if
a seed pod had snapped
asunder. A faint perfume
surrounded her, rare and
subtle as if it had been
blown across from some
flower of Eden. Olga
looked down and found herself
enveloped in a robe of
such delicate texture, that
it seemed soft as a rose-leaf
and as airy as pink clouds<!-- Page 20 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
that sometimes float across
the sunset. The water-lilies
in her hair had become a
coronal of opals.</p>

<p>When she entered the
great ball-room, the Prince
of the castle started up from
his throne in amazement.
Never before had he seen
such a vision of loveliness.
"Surely," said he, "some
rose of Paradise hath found
a soul and drifted earthward<!-- Page 21 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
to blossom here." And all
that night he had eyes for
none but her.</p>

<p>The next night Olga
started again to the castle
in her dress of tow, and at
the gate she grasped the
second bead in her fingers,
repeating the charm. This
time the pale yellow of the
daffodils seemed to have
woven itself into a cloth of
gold for her adorning. It<!-- Page 22 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
was like a shimmer of
moon-beams, and her hair
held the diamond flashings
of a hundred tiny stars.</p>

<p>That night the Prince paid
her so many compliments
and singled her out so often
to bestow his favours, that
Olga's head was turned.
She tossed it proudly, and
quite scorned the thought of
the humble cottage which
had given her shelter so<!-- Page 23 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
long. The next day when
she had returned to her
gown of tow and was no
longer a haughty court lady,
but only Olga, the Flax-spinner's
maiden, she repined
at her lot. Frowning,
she carried the water from
the spring. Frowning, she
gathered the cresses and
plucked the woodland fruit.
And then she sat all day by
the spring, refusing to<!-- Page 24 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
spread the linen on the
grass to bleach.</p>

<p>She was discontented
with the old life of toil,
and pouted crossly because
duties called her when she
wanted to do nothing but
sit idly dreaming of the gay
court scenes in which she
had taken a bright brief
part. The old Flax-spinner's
fingers trembled as she
spun, when she saw the<!-- Page 25 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
frowns, for she had given
of her heart's blood to buy
happiness for this maiden
she loved, and well she
knew there can be no happiness
where frowns abide.
She felt that her years of
sacrifice had been in vain,
but when the Oak wagged
his head she called back
waveringly, "My little Olga
will not be ungrateful and
forgetful!"<!-- Page 26 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>That night outside the
castle gate, Olga paused.
She had forgotten the
charm. The day's discontent
had darkened her
memory as storm-clouds
darken the sky. But she
grasped her necklace imperiously.</p>

<p>"Deck me at once!" she
cried in a haughty tone.
"Clothe me more beautifully
than mortal maid was<!-- Page 27 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
ever clad before, so that I
may find favour in the
Prince's sight and become
the bride of the castle! I
would that I were done for
ever with the spindle and
the distaff!"</p>

<p>But the moon went under
a cloud and the wind began
to moan around the turrets.
The black night hawks in
the forest flapped their
wings warningly, and the<!-- Page 28 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
black bats flitted low around
her head.</p>

<p>"Obey me at once!" she
cried angrily, stamping her
foot and jerking at the
necklace. But the string
broke, and the beads went
rolling away in the darkness
in every direction and were
lost&mdash;all but one, which
she held clasped in her
hand.</p>

<p>Then Olga wept at the<!-- Page 29 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
castle gate; wept outside in
the night and the darkness,
in her peasant's garb of tow.
But after awhile through
her sobbing, stole the answering
sob of the night
wind.</p>

<p>"Hush-sh!" it seemed to
say. "Sh-sh! Never a heart
can come to harm, if the lips
but speak the old dame's
charm."</p>

<p>The voice of the night<!-- Page 30 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
wind sounded so much like
the voice of the old Flax-spinner,
that Olga was
startled and looked around
wonderingly. Then suddenly
she seemed to see the
thatched cottage and the
bent form of the lonely old
woman at the wheel. All
the years in which the good
dame had befriended her
seemed to rise up in a row,
and out of each one called<!-- Page 31 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
a thousand kindnesses as
with one voice: "How canst
thou forget us, Olga? We
were done for love's sweet
sake, and that alone!"</p>

<p>Then was Olga sorry and
ashamed that she had been
so proud and forgetful, and
she wept again. The tears
seemed to clear her vision,
for now she saw plainly
that through no power of
her own could she wrest<!-- Page 32 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
strange favours from fortune.
Only the power of
the old charm could make
them hers. She remembered
it then, and holding
fast the one bead in
her hand, she repeated
humbly:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"For love's sweet sake, in my hour of need,<br />
Blossom and deck me, little seed."</p></div>

<p>Lo, as the words left her
lips, the moon shone out
from behind the clouds<!-- Page 33 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
above the dark forest.
There was a fragrance of
lilies all about, and a gossamer
gown floated around
her, whiter than the whiteness
of the fairest lily. It
was fine like the finest lace
the frost-elves weave, and
softer than the softest ermine
of the snow. On her
long golden hair gleamed a
coronet of pearls.</p>

<p>So beautiful, so dazzling<!-- Page 34 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
was she as she entered the
castle door, that the Prince
came down to meet her, and
kneeling, kissed her hand
and claimed her as his
bride. Then came the
bishop in his mitre, and led
her to the throne, and before
them all the Flax-spinner's
maiden was married to the
Prince, and made the Princess
Olga.</p>

<p>Then until the seven days<!-- Page 35 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
and seven nights were done,
the revels lasted in the
castle. And in the merriment
the old Flax-spinner
was again forgotten. Her
kindness of the past, her
loneliness in the present had
no part in the thoughts of
the Princess Olga.</p>

<p>All night the old Oak, tapping
on the thatch, called
down, "Thou'rt forgotten!
Thou'rt forgotten!"<!-- Page 36 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>But the beads that had
rolled away in the darkness,
buried themselves in the
earth, and took root, and
sprang up, as the old
woman knew they would
do. There at the castle
gate they bloomed, a
strange, strange flower, for
on every stem hung a row
of little bleeding hearts.</p>

<p>One day the Princess
Olga, seeing them from her<!-- Page 37 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
window, went down to them
in wonderment.</p>

<p>"What do you here?"
she cried, for in her forest
life she'd learned all speech
of bird and beast and
plant.</p>

<p>"We bloom for love's
sweet sake," they answered.
"We have sprung from the
old Flax-spinner's gift&mdash;the
necklace thou didst break
and scatter. From her<!-- Page 38 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
heart's best blood she
gave it, and her heart still
bleeds to think she is forgotten."</p>

<p>Then they began to tell
the story of the old dame's
sacrifices, all the seventy
times seven that she had
made for the sake of the
maiden, and Olga grieved as
she listened, that she could
have been so ungrateful.
Then she brought the<!-- Page 39 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Prince to hear the story of
the strange, strange flowers,
and when he had heard,

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
